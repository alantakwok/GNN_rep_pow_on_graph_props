# Representation power of graph neural networks for learning graph properties

This project investigates and compares the effectiveness of different types of graph neural networks at learning and predicting different graph properties.  
Authors: Zhenhan Huang, Anubhav Halder, Shiuli Subhra Ghosh and Alanta Kwok. 

## Requirements
The majority of code has been implemented through Python; the NetworkX and Keras modules are required for graph generation and neural network models to run. Plot visualizations can be accessed through installation of the Jupyter Notebook module.

## Usage
Prior to running the codes for neural network models it is required to place all graph data files in the same directory.  
Similarly for visualization, one should place all results data files in the same directory.

## Results
A detailed description of findings can be found in the Progress Report. One may also refer to `/results_images` for visualizations.
